# React Testing

Testing used to be something that requires a lot efforts to setup, because there are a few moving parts for you to write tests:

1. test runner (the code that will extract all the test code from your code and run them, generate and display test results)
1. assertion library (the utilities for you to make assertion about your result)
1. mocking and spying (in a real-world application, you would definitely need mocking whenever there are indeterminate functionlities or it's expensive to setup end-to-end application)
1. test coverage reports
1. provide a browser or browser-like environment

However, thanks to [Jest], all of these are included in single library with minimal configuration.

## Setup Jest

To setup Jest for our application:

1. run `npm install -D jest babel-jest babel-core@7.0.0-bridge.0`
1. add a `test` npm script in `package.json`

   ```json
   ...
   "test": "jest"
   ...
   ```

Now you're good to go to write your test and run them.

## Testing Javascript (not React specific)

Let's start with writing test for javascript function.

Once you get an idea of how to test javascript, then we will go through how to test React component.

### Creating utility function to generate className

A common utility that you would need when writing React is to generate className to be attached to DOM element for styling based on props.

The offical packages to do that is a package known as [classnames], however, for the sake of learning let's write it as our own code.

Create a file `lib.js` with the content from [this gist](https://gist.github.com/malcolm-kee/30cd26b80c5f45e443ae44dd5a3b4f01).

- `classNames` is a function that take any number of arguments, and join them together as a string. Only string and number will be included in final results and falsy value will be excluded. String will be flattened
- Example usage:

  ```js
  // simple usage
  classNames('btn', 'btn--default'); // 'btn btn--default'

  // use ternary expression as falsy value will be ignored
  classNames('btn', true && 'btn--default', false && 'btn--raised', null); // 'btn btn--default'

  // you may pass down array if you wish, and it will be flattened
  classNames(['btn', null, 'btn--default']); // 'btn btn--default'
  ```

### Create test for the utility function

Let's write unit test for the utility function.

Create a file `lib.test.js` next to `lib.js`. Write the following test case as per usage above.

```js
import { classNames } from './lib.js';

test('classNames', () => {
  expect(classNames('btn', 'btn--default')).toBe('btn btn--default');
  expect(
    classNames('btn', true && 'btn--default', false && 'btn--raised', null)
  ).toBe('btn btn--default');
  expect(classNames(['btn', null, 'btn--default'])).toBe('btn btn--default');
});
```

Now when you run `npm run test`, you should be able to see the following output:

```bash
 PASS  src/lib.test.js
  âˆš classNames (5ms)

Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       1 passed, 1 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        1.789s, estimated 2s
Ran all test suites.
```

Congratulations! You just written your first test.

- By default, jest will look for any files that is inside folder `__test__` or file name end with `.test.js` or `spec.js`. Therefore by naming the file as `lib.test.js`, the file will be treated as test file that jest need to run. I recommend to place the test file next to the code that it's testing with the naming convention `<code-under-test>.test.js`, so that it's clear on the purpose of the test, and what code has test associated with it.
- When jest run the test file, it will injects few variables globally, e.g. `test` and `expect`.
- `test` is used to wrap your unit test and give it a name. When your test fails, the test name will be displayed in the console.
- `expect` is used to assert the result of your test. Common usages are:

  - `expect(result).toBe(expectedValue)` (use `===` for equality check)
  - `expect(result).toEqual(expectedValue)` (recursively check for equality for objecy)
  - `expect(result).toBeDefined()` (equivalent to `expect(result).not.toBe(undefined)`)

    Read through the [docs][jest-expect] to be aware of the supported assertions.

## Additional Configurations of Jest

Let's explore some common configurations when using Jest.

### Fix ESLint Error

You may realize that ESLint is showing error in your test file that `'test' is not defined` and `'expect' is not defined`. However, to fix that error is just a line of code. Update your `.eslintrc` file `env` properties:

```json
...
"env": {
    "es6": true,
    "browser": true,
    "node": true,
    "jest": true
}
...
```

Now the error should be gone now.

### Watch mode

It's common that you may want to keep Jest in watch mode while writing tests, so any change of the test will trigger a re-run and ensure the test is passed.

To run jest in watch mode:

1. add a new npm script: `"test:watch": "jest --watch"`
1. run `npm run test:watch`
1. explore the watch mode options (`p` to filter filename, `t` to filter test name)

### Code Coverage Reports

You may want to explore how many of your code is covered.

To generate code coverage report:

1. add a new npm script: `"test:coverage": "jest --coverage"`
1. run `npm run test:coverage`
1. explore the `coverage/lcov-report` folder that has been generated. Open the `index.html` file with your browser.

## :pencil: Do It: configure Jest and write unit tests

1. install Jest as described and configure your npm scripts.
1. copy the utility code as provided and write the tests to test the function.
1. run `npm run test` and verify that the tests are passed.
1. fix ESLint error as described
1. run test in watch mode as described
1. generate code coverage report as described
1. (optional) write unit tests for the function `joinString`.
