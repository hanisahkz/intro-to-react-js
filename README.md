# Intro to React JS

A complete introduction to ReactJS - up and running with ReactJS by learning tooling that improves your development workflow, ReactJS core API, and common how-to e.g. writing tests, routing, and code splitting.

> This repo outlines the content of the workshop - separate repo will be written as a code-along sample for the workshop.

## Prerequisite

This workshop assumes that:

- you have at least basic understanding of HTML/CSS/JS. If you know how to add a button element in a HTML and a script tag to make clicking the button do something interactive like a popup, then you're good to go.
- you have a basic idea of what a source-control system is. This workshop will use git, but you won't be expected to know how to use it. Exact git command will be provided so you to copy and paste during the workshop.
